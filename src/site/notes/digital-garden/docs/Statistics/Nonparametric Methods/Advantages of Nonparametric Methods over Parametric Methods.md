**Advantages of Nonparametric Methods over Parametric Methods**

Nonparametric methods have several advantages over parametric methods in statistical analysis:

1. **Robustness:** Nonparametric methods are robust to violations of distributional assumptions. They do not assume that the data follows a specific probability distribution, making them suitable for a wide range of data types.

2. **Flexibility:** Nonparametric methods can be applied to both continuous and discrete data, as well as data with unknown or complex distributions. This flexibility is particularly useful in real-world scenarios where data may not conform to theoretical distributions.

3. **Resistance to Outliers:** Nonparametric methods are less sensitive to outliers compared to parametric methods that rely on means and variances. Outliers have a reduced impact on nonparametric analyses.

4. **Small Sample Sizes:** Nonparametric tests can be more reliable with small sample sizes since they do not require as many data points to make valid inferences. This is especially beneficial in cases where data collection is challenging or expensive.

5. **Distribution-Free:** Nonparametric methods are distribution-free, meaning they make minimal or no assumptions about the shape or characteristics of the underlying population distribution. This makes them appropriate when little is known about the data distribution.

6. **[[digital-garden/docs/Statistics/Data Analysis and Visualization/Data Type/Ordinal Data\|Ordinal Data]]:** Nonparametric methods can handle ordinal data, which represents ordered categories without assuming equal intervals between categories. Parametric methods often require interval or ratio data.

7. **Non-Normal Data:** When data is not normally distributed, nonparametric methods can provide valid results without the need for transformations or data manipulation.

8. **Ease of Interpretation:** Nonparametric results are often easier to interpret and communicate to non-statistical audiences because _they rely on ranks and medians_ rather than complex statistical parameters.

In summary, nonparametric methods offer greater versatility and robustness when dealing with diverse datasets and situations where parametric assumptions are not met. They are a valuable alternative for researchers and analysts looking to draw meaningful conclusions without making strong distributional assumptions.
